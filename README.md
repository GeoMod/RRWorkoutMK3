# RRWorkoutMK3

I built this app as a prototype to learn about using HealthKit and CoreMotion in a workout app. This is a watchOS only app which specifically demonstrates outdoor running capability with running pace information from the CoreMotion pedometer. Access to HealthKit data is also used to read and write heart rate, calories burned and distance traveled while walking or running.

During my research I had trouble finding references on the use of the CoreMotion Pedometer, which is why I am publishing this repo so that it might be of use to others.

As this is a prototype the workout type has been hard coded as an outdoor run with distance travelled and pace measured in miles and minutes per mile respectively. Functionality is available for metric units as well.

The app is built with the SwiftUI lifecycle.
